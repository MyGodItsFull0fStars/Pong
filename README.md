# Pong

Small University project to get started using Phaser.
Since I'm a beginner in creating games, every input is highly appreciated and the following text is just a summary of the commit changes.

First, a Web Server needs to be set up to start the game. This can be achieved either with an IDE like WebStorm by Jetbrains or following one of the different methods in the following link: https://www.phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started/index


With first commit it is still rather Pong, but uses different png's for ball and paddle. (back then a volleyball as a ball)
Also tried out hands as paddles, since it would fit the volleyball. 

Update 21:00 22.03.2017:
Since this is just the Getting Started with my first Phaser project, it is mostly fooling around with different png's and sounds.
Changed the paddles to Battle axes and also the sound to an axe swing when hitting the ball.

Update 21:30:
Added a better fitting bounce sound and changed a few filenames. E.g. files containing sounds end with _sound.

Update 23.03.2017 22:00:
Today background music/graphic were added. Also added left/right movement to the paddles for more dynamic playstyle
