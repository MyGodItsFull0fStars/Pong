# Pong

Small University project to get started using Phaser.
With first commit it is still rather Pong, but uses different png's for ball and paddle at the moment.


Update:
Since this is just the Getting Started with my first Phaser project, it is mostly fooling around with different png's and sounds.
Changed the paddles to Battle axes and also the sound to an axe swing when hitting the ball.
